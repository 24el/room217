\subsubsection*{Install from an Archive File}

Extract the archive file downloaded from \href{http://www.yiiframework.com/download/}{\tt yiiframework.\+com} to a directory named {\ttfamily basic} that is directly under the Web root.

Set cookie validation key in {\ttfamily config/web.\+php} file to some random secret string\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{stringliteral}{'request'} => [
    \textcolor{comment}{// !!! insert a secret key in the following (if it is empty) - this is required by cookie validation}
    \textcolor{stringliteral}{'cookieValidationKey'} => \textcolor{stringliteral}{'<secret random string goes here>'},
],
\end{DoxyCode}


You can then access the application through the following U\+RL\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
http://localhost/basic/web/
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Install via Composer}

If you do not have \href{http://getcomposer.org/}{\tt Composer}, you may install it by following the instructions at \href{http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix}{\tt getcomposer.\+org}.

You can then install this project template using the following command\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
php composer.phar global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:~1.1.1"
php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist --stability=dev yiisoft/yii2-app-basic basic
\end{DoxyCode}


Now you should be able to access the application through the following U\+RL, assuming {\ttfamily basic} is the directory directly under the Web root.


\begin{DoxyCode}
http://localhost/basic/web/
\end{DoxyCode}

\subsubsection*{Database}

Edit the file {\ttfamily config/db.\+php} with real data, for example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{keywordflow}{return} [
    \textcolor{stringliteral}{'class'} => \textcolor{stringliteral}{'yii\(\backslash\)db\(\backslash\)Connection'},
    \textcolor{stringliteral}{'dsn'} => \textcolor{stringliteral}{'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2basic'},
    \textcolor{stringliteral}{'username'} => \textcolor{stringliteral}{'root'},
    \textcolor{stringliteral}{'password'} => \textcolor{stringliteral}{'1234'},
    \textcolor{stringliteral}{'charset'} => \textcolor{stringliteral}{'utf8'},
];
\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries N\+O\+T\+ES\+:}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Yii won\textquotesingle{}t create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
\item Check and edit the other files in the {\ttfamily config/} directory to customize your application as required.
\item Refer to the R\+E\+A\+D\+ME in the {\ttfamily tests} directory for information specific to basic application tests.
